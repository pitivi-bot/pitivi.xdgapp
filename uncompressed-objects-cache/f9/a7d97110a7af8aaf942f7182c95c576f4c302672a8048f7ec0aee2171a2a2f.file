    <title>Work in progress</title>
     <p>You may encounter unwritten portions due to features that have not yet been implemented in Pitivi at the time of writing.</p>
     <p>You may also encounter smaller areas which have been documented in this manual but have not been implemented in Pitivi – those are areas where the design and expected user interaction are quite narrow/certain.</p>
